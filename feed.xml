It’s not impossible to take the time to mine some more and polish the finding, but often it’s not entirely clear that it will develop into something valuable. Instead, I’ve decided to scratch these marks along the trail, so that if anyone else wanders this same stretch, they might easily find the spectacle themselves to see if it might be of any use to them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As with others, I often err, so take heed that there could be better paths to follow, and if a blaze seems inappropriately placed, feel free to suggest a correction.&lt;/p&gt;
